# Flipper Zero Laser Pointer
laser ~~sharks~~ dolphins.

This is a very simple application for the Flipper Zero that toggles the 5v power rail when the OK button is pressed/held.

The eventual plan is to integrate this code into a fork of the hid app (bluetooth keynote) to allow the user to use the flipper as a laser pointer and slide controller.

## Building

To build this application, run [`ufbt`](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt)


# The hardware
very simple, very demure

Simply connect the + and - terminals on the laser diode to the 5v and gnd pins on the flipper zero.
(pardon the bad soldering)
